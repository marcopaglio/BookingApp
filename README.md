BookingApp is a simple desktop application for managing reservations developed with TDD, build automation and continuous integration practices. Once the application is launched, you can add your clients and their reservations via a GUI. Informations are stored in a database server running as a Docker container. BookingApp is compatible with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL DBMSs.<br>

## Before you start

### Is your machine compatible?

If you just launch the BookingApp application with PostgreSQL as DBMS there are no *known* machine requirements.<br>

Otherwise, the BookingApp project runs a Docker container with MongoDB, the version of which is greater than 5.0 and requires the use of AVX instructions. To determine whether your CPU model supports AVX, check the manufacturerâ€™s website and enter your CPU model number. Alternatively, below there are other methods specific to the Operating System (OS).

> N.B: Even if your machine supports AVX instructions, a hosted Virtual Machine may disable them due to virtualization issues. See the section on [Running on Virtual Machine](#running-on-virtual-machine) for fixing this possible problem.

#### Linux and MacOS

To check if CPU has AVX capabilities on Unix systems, run the following command on the terminal:
```
grep avx /proc/cpuinfo
``` 
If the output is not empty then your cores have AVX support.

#### Windows 

On Windows systems, enable AVX capabilities directly by running the following command on a Command Prompt as Administrator:
```
bcdedit /set xsavedisable 0
``` 
If you see a confirmation message then your cores have AVX support.

### Running on Virtual Machine

It is possible to clone and run BookingApp on a OS installed on a Virtual Machine (VM) program (e.g. VirtualBox, VMware Workstations, etc.), but it may not work due to lack of support for AVX/AVX2 instructions, even if your host machine's CPU supports them. 

#### Hosted by Windows 11

On Windows 11 the supporting of AVX/AVX2 instructions in a VM may fail due to virtualization problems. In this case it's necessary to:
- *disable the hypervisor launch which is enabled by default*.
  
  First of all, check if the hypervisor is executing: press together **WIN + R** > enter **msinfo32** > in the **System Summary** window you should find the following entry (otherwise skip over to the next point): `A hypervisor was detected. The features required for Hyper-V will not be displayed`. In this case, open a Command Prompt as Administrator and run `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off`. Then restart your machine for applying changes.<br>
  
  When you need to undo the changes, open a Command Prompt as Administrator and run `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto`. Then restart your machine for applying changes.
  
- *disable Windows security Memory Integrity*.

  > Attention :exclamation:: This is a very bad thing to do because the Memory integrity feature is stated to *prevent injection attacks into virtualization-based security processes*. Unfortunately, this is require in order to enable AVX/AVX2 instructions in VMs.
  
  You can find it on **Settings** > **Windows Security** > **Device security** > **Core isolation details** > **Memory integrity**. As soon as turned this feature off, restart your machine to allow Windows to apply the change.  

If everything went right, your VM should now support AVX/AVX2 instructions as well as the host machine. You can make this check running the [previous section](#is-your-machine-compatible) instructions on the OS installed on your VM. If you're using VirtualBox you can make this check earlier by looking at the below right side of your running VM: there must be an icon like ![a chip with a V letter inside](/../screenshots/screenshot-chip-icon.png?raw=true "V chip icon"). Instead, if you see an icon like ![a turtle with a V letter inside](/../screenshots/screenshot-turtle-icon.png?raw=true "V turtle icon"), it means that hypervisor is still running (and the virtualization is slower, just like a turtle) then AVX/AVX2 core instructions will be not supported.  

> N.B: It is really recommended to revert all the changes here described as soon as you no longer have to use the VM.

### What else?

To use the BookingApp application, the following programs must be installed on your machine:
1. Java SDK (and JRE?) 11 (or more?)
2. Docker engine and Docker compose

To replicate builds, tests and so on, the BookingApp project also requires the following programs installed on your machine:
3. Git

If you wanna use an IDE:
4. Eclipse IDE
5. Maven v.x.y.z

**START: CHECK IF TO MANTAIN** :arrow_down:
#### 1. Install Java SDK (and JRE) 11

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

##### Linux (Ubuntu)

First of all, check if Java JRE is already installed, running the following commands on terminal:
java -version
and:
javac --version
If it appears something like:
openjdk version "11.0.21"
and:
javac 11.0.21
Then you have already installed java, and you have to pass to next part of tutorial (link on words).
Otherwise, if there is another version (major versions are ok or not?), or something like:
Command 'java' not found
or:
Command 'javac' not found
These responses indicate that the necessary Java version is not installed and you can proceed with the next steps.

Before installing any new package is reccomanded to update your package listing with the most recent information:
sudo apt-get update
Install the JDK with the following commands:
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
The full Java suite includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and utilities to develop Java source code.
The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides everything a user needs to run Java applications. 
To validate the successful install of Java on Ubuntu with apt, issue the following command:
java -version
openjdk version "11.0.21"
and
javac --version
javac 11.0.21
TODO: set JAVA_HOME?

#### 2. Install Git

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

##### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
The verify the installation was successful by typing:
git --version
TODO: configure username and email?

#### 3. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

##### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

A complete step-by-step guide is provided by the official page:
LINK: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

#### 4. Install Eclipse IDE

The installation guide depending on your operating system.

##### Linux (Ubuntu)

On Ubuntu Software application is stored Eclipse. So just find it on the store and install clicking the right botton. Then you can open the application.<br>

**END: CHECK IF TO MANTAIN** :arrow_up:

## Clone the BookingApp project

There are essentially two main ways for cloning, and then using, the BookingApp project: the Git command line or the import mode of an IDE.

> InfoPoint :information_source:: The first way is the simplest because it doesn't require any IDE or Maven installation. Anyway, the BookingApp project was developed using Eclipse, recommended if your goal is to use an IDE.

### Git command line

If you decide to use the Git command line, choose any folder and run on the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcopaglio/BookingApp.git
```
A copy of the BookingApp project will be downloaded.

#### What if you now want to use Eclipse?

If you have already cloned the BookingApp project via Git command line and now want to use Eclipse, change the second step of the [Import from Eclipse](#import-from-eclipse) guide with the following one so as to avoid cloning again:

2. From the top left bar: **File** > **Open Projects from File System...** > use **Directory..** to choose for the project root directory > **Open** > make sure of selecting the `Search for nested projects` option > from the Folder list, import all subfolders but not the root folder `BookingApp` > **Finish**.

### Eclipse Smart Imports

> InfoPoint :information_source:: Following steps have been defined using EclipseIDE 2022-12 and 2023-09. Different versions may involve slightly different steps.

If you decide to use the Eclipse import mode for cloning the BookingApp project:

1. Once installed, open Eclipse and choose any workspace location.
2. From the top left bar: **File** > **Import** > **Git** > **Projects from Git** > **Github** > search for the repository `marcopaglio/BookingApp` > select only the `main` branch > **Next** > choose any directory as project root directory > **Next** > select all modules from the list > **Finish**.
   
Just imported on Eclipse, there may be appeared some errors (about dependencies) on the `Problems` tab. Don't worry, just **File** > **Refresh** once and they will go away.

#### Eclipse settings

Opening files which define DTD or XSD schemas, like `pom.xml` and `persistence.xml` in the BookingApp project, requires those schemas to be downloaded and stored locally (e.g. on Linux they are found in the `.lemminx` folder). In this regard, if you find the error message `Downloading external resources is disabled` coming from these files, you can fix that by modifying Eclipse settings: **Window** > **Preferences** > **XML (Wild Web Developer)** > tick `Download external resources like referenced DTD, XSD` > **Apply** > **Apply and Close**.

## Build the BookingApp project

Before the very first build, in order to avoid timeout failures, you need to store DBMSs' Docker image locally by running the following commands on the terminal:
```
docker pull mongo:6.0.7
docker pull postgres:15.3
```
After that, place yourself into the project root directory, where the Maven Wrapper files (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, etc.) are stored, open a Command Prompt, and continue with the guide depending on your OS.

### Linux

On Linux systems, build the project by running the following command:
```
./mvnw -f booking-aggregator/pom.xml clean install
```
Its execution will remove unnecessary files generated in previous builds and install dependencies locally for each module. In this way, you can then build each sub-module indipendently, just change `booking-aggregator` with one between `booking-domain-module`, `booking-business-module` and `booking-ui-module` in the previous command.<br>
Additionally, all unit, integration and end-to-end tests will be performed with Maven. If the command is executed for a sub-module, tests will be executed only for the specific module.<br>

Alternative builds can be run adding one or more profiles at the end of the previous command:

- `-Pjacoco` add test coverage.
  
  BookingApp project already provides test coverage results on [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/marcopaglio/BookingApp?branch=main), but you can see them for yourself once execution finishes at `/booking-report/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html`.
  
- `-Ppitest` add mutation testing.
  
  BookingApp project already provides mutation testing results on the [website](https://marcopaglio.github.io/BookingApp/pit-reports/index.html), but you can see them for yourself once execution finishes at `/booking-report/target/pit-reports/index.html`.
  
- `-Pdocker` add dockerization of the application.

  > Note: docker profile will open BookingApp inside a Docker container, therefore it needs the access to the Linux X display server in order to work propertly:
  > - run the following command for showing all the net interfaces:<br>
  >   `ifconfig`
  >   
  >   > It may be necessary install the package for running it: `sudo apt install net-tools`
  >   
  > - from the printed list, find out the Docker virtual bridge (alias *<DOCKER_NET>*) which all the containers are connected to (as default it is `docker0`).
  > - run the following command before using docker profile or docker-compose:<br>
  >   `xhost +local:<DOCKER_NET>` e.g: `xhost +local:docker0`  
  > - When running finishes, it is recommanded to remove the access to the X display server by running:<br>
  >   `xhost -local:<DOCKER_NET>` e.g: `xhost -local:docker0`

7. On Linux run xhost+ before running docker-compose or Maven docker profile (and xhost- as soon as it stop).

You can also build the BookingApp project using the command `mvn` instead of `./mvnw`, but without Maven Wrapper build might fails due to different versions of Maven. For this reason building with maven Wrapper is recommended. If you prefer taking your risks, you can also run launch files from Eclipse. They are located inside `booking-aggregate`, `booking-domain-module`, `booking-business-module` and `booking-ui-module` into `launches` folders. Just right click on the .launch file, select **Run As**, and click on the same name maven configuration for starting the building. Remember that launch files in Reactor execute on the whole project, while the others execute on the single module, so they need to have dependencies installed before starting.
